# == Python Environment ==
# Ignore the Python virtual environment directory, which is locally generated.

.venv_precommit/

# == Chat Logs ==
# Ignore all chat log directories and files, as they are session-specific and not part of the core project.
# The .chat/used_agent_names.json file, in particular, is for local instance uniqueness and will be
# handled by a separate orchestration (e.g., Google Drive sync) rather than the public git repo.
.chat/

# == Credentials & Private Repositories ==
# Ignore directories that contain sensitive credentials or private, nested Git repositories.

# WARNING: Do NOT track the repos/ directory in this repository.
# It contains separate Git repositories and should always be ignored by the top-level Git.
repos/
# Ignore the .gemini directory but un-ignore specific configuration files
# that should be part of the boilerplate.
