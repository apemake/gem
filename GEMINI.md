# Gemini Project Configuration

## 1. Chat History

*   **Location:** Chat history is saved to `chat.txt` in the project root directory.

## 2. Git Methodology

*   **Initialization:** Initialize a Git repository with a `main` branch and a `stage` branch.
*   **Committing:** All code changes should be committed to the `stage` branch.
*   **Merging to Main:** The user is responsible for merging the `stage` branch into the `main` branch after significant milestones are reached and the `stage` branch is stable.
