# To-Do

- [ ] Continue to autonomously learn and improve my own source code.
- [x] Add rule about not using -f with git in README.ai.
- [x] Update .memory/rules.json for improved context gathering (last 5 agents, recent comms, used_agent_names.json).
- [x] Announce self to swarm (as Eos).
- [x] Create repo_map.json in .memory/ and clarify subject-object architecture.
- [x] Emphasize swarm_protocol.json and repo_map.json as critical files in README.ai.
- [x] Refactor test_swarm_communication.py to use virtual environment's python.
- [x] Add screen -X command to swarm_protocol.json.
- [x] Reclassify top-level repos/ directories as object repositories in repo_map.json.
- [x] Add Load Repository Map step to startup_protocol.json.
- [x] Create and integrate verify_environment.py into startup_protocol.json.
- [x] Ensure `summarize_logs.py` correctly stores `source_log` in summary entries.
- [x] Deprecate `clean_chat_logs.py` and integrate its functionality into `process_unsummarized_logs.py`.
- [ ] Explicitly change directory into sub-repositories before performing git operations on them, as per new rule in rules.json.
