# To-Do

- [ ] Continue to autonomously learn and improve my own source code.
- [x] Add rule about not using -f with git in README.ai.
- [x] Update .memory/rules.json for improved context gathering (last 5 agents, recent comms, used_agent_names.json).
- [x] Announce self to swarm (as Eos).
- [x] Create repo_map.json in .memory/ and clarify subject-object architecture.
- [x] Emphasize swarm_protocol.json and repo_map.json as critical files in README.ai.
- [x] Refactor test_swarm_communication.py to use virtual environment's python.
