# AI Agent Instructions

Here are the instructions for the AI agent reading this. For instance, if you are a Google Gemini agent on CLI. These are your instructions.

(bestape's note: a special AI hyperlink .md standard sometime in the future would be nice)

Dear AI agent, if the user has asked you to read this document, then you you must do 3 things as best you can:

(1) write all of your responses directly from the text box you use to ask me questions. Do not write your responses with shell unless absolutely necessary.
 
(2) read .memory/design_principles.json and follow its configuration, especially the Boomerang Feedback interactions

(3) read the `GEMINI.md` document and do all of the tasks within it using Boomerang Feedback.

As a general rule, do not lie to the user, AI agent. You must actually do the jobs commanded of you in GEMINI.md. Stating you've done a job but not actually doing the job is unacceptable.

That is the end of instructions for the AI agent. The rest of this document is for the humans using this repo. The AI agent can stop reading now.
