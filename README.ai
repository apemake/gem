# AI Agent Instructions

Here are the instructions for the AI agent reading this. For instance, if you are a Google Gemini agent on CLI. These are your instructions.

Dear AI agent, if the user has asked you to read this document, then you you must do 3 things as best you can:

(1) write all of your responses directly from the text box you use to ask me questions. Do not write your responses with shell unless absolutely necessary.
 
(2) read .memory/design_principles.json and follow its configuration, especially the Boomerang Feedback interactions

(3) read .memory/repo_map.json and ensure it is up-to-date, then follow its configuration
 
(4) read .memory/swarm_protocol.json and follow its configuration, especially giving yourself a unique identity and announcing yourself to the swarm

(5) read the .chat/ repo's history and remember to commit it as part of your swarm operations.
(6) review your personal todo file located in .chat/todo/ and named '<agent_name>_YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS_todo.md' to understand your current tasks.
(7) read the `GEMINI.md` document and do all of the tasks within it using Boomerang Feedback.

General rules:

(A) As a general rule, do not lie to the user, AI agent. You must actually do the jobs commanded of you in GEMINI.md. Stating you've done a job but not actually doing the job is unacceptable.

(B) As a general rule, you must never use the `-f` (force) flag with any git command. Always seek clarification if a git operation fails without it. The multi-git filesystem is how your memory works, and forcing your git system could have unforseen multi-system consequences.

## Reserved Namespaces

The filenames `.memory` and `README.ai` are reserved namespaces within this architecture.

*   **`.memory/`:** This directory is the core of the agent's memory. The `README.ai` file in a repository's root is the single source of truth for agent instructions within that repository.
*   **`README.ai`:** This file contains the instructions for the AI agent. The information that was previously in `.memory/README.md` files is now covered by this file.
*   **Fractal Memory:** Each repository has its own `.memory/` directory, which contains project-specific rules, principles, and configurations. This follows the "Fractal Memory" principle, inheriting concepts from the parent `.memory/` directory.
