    "summary": "A protocol for the agent to follow upon startup.",
    "steps": [
      "**1. Identify self:**",
      "  - Upon startup, the agent must identify its own process ID (PID).",
      "  - The agent should then inspect the running `script` processes to find the one associated with its PID.",
      "  - The agent will then know which `.chat/` log file it is writing to.",
      "**2. Log self-identification:**",
      "  - The agent will log a message to its own chat log, stating its name and the log file it is associated with.",
      "  - This will help with debugging and identifying which agent is which.",
      "**3. Announce existence to swarm:**",
      "  - The agent will follow the `swarm_protocol.json` to announce its existence to the swarm."
