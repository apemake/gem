      "name": "Highly Structured JavaScript for Type Annotation",
      "description": "Our programming legalese, characterized by highly structured JavaScript, inherently annotates type through its consistent and explicit structural patterns. This approach ensures clarity, predictability, and facilitates static analysis without relying solely on formal type annotation syntax.",

      "benefits": [
        "Improved code readability and maintainability",
        "Reduced type-related errors",
        "Enhanced static analysis capabilities",
        "Clearer communication of data structures and interfaces"
