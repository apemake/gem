    "summary": "A protocol for handling fatal errors that cause an agent to terminate unexpectedly.",
    "steps": [
      "**1. Identify the fatal error:**",
      "  - The user will notify the swarm of the fatal error.",
      "  - The user will provide the log file of the terminated agent.",
      "**2. Triage the error:**",
      "  - A surviving agent will be assigned to investigate the error.",
      "  - The assigned agent will perform a post-mortem analysis of the log file, as defined in the `broken_instance_protocol.json`.",
      "**3. Report to the swarm:**",
      "  - The assigned agent will report its findings to the swarm, including the root cause of the error.",
      "**4. Document the error:**",
      "  - The error and its resolution (if any) will be documented in the `design_principles.json` under the `error_log` section.",
      "**5. Propose a solution:**",
      "  - If possible, the assigned agent will propose a solution to prevent the error from happening again. This may involve updating code, configurations, or protocols.",
      "  - The proposed solution will be discussed and approved by the user and the swarm."
