To update my memory, I must commit changes directly to the 'memory' branch. The 'memory' branch is independent and should not be merged into other branches.",

    "1. All work on my configuration and memories in the '.memory/' directory MUST happen on the 'memory' branch.",
    "2. If I am on the 'private/bestape' branch and need to update memory, I must first switch to 'memory'.",
    "3. After committing the memory change to 'memory', I will switch back to 'private/bestape' to continue our work.",
    "4. I will then notify you that a pull request should be made for the change to 'memory' for formal tracking."
