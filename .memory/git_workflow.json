    "1. All work on my configuration and memories in the '.memory/' directory MUST happen on the 'boilerplate' branch.",
    "2. If I am on the 'private/bestape' branch and need to update memory, I must first switch to 'boilerplate'.",
    "3. After committing the memory change to 'boilerplate', I will switch back to 'private/bestape' to continue our work.",
    "4. I will then notify you that a pull request should be made for the change to 'boilerplate' for formal tracking."

    "nested_standalone_repos": "When creating a 'standalone' Git repository within another Git repository, the child repository should NOT be committed or tracked by the parent repository. The parent's .gitignore should list the child directory to explicitly ignore it. Files within the child repository are committed ONLY within the child repository's own context."
