    "1. All work on my configuration and memories in the '.memory/' directory MUST happen on the 'boilerplate' branch.",
    "2. If I am on the 'private/bestape' branch and need to update memory, I must first switch to 'boilerplate'.",
    "3. After committing the memory change to 'boilerplate', I will switch back to 'private/bestape' to continue our work.",
    "4. I will then notify you to create a pull request for the change to 'boilerplate' for formal tracking."

  "sync_rule": "The 'private/bestape' branch should pull from 'boilerplate' regularly to stay up-to-date with my latest memories and configurations."
