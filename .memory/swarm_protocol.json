      {
        "name": "Triggered Mode",
        "description": "Agents operate in a 'triggered' mode. After completing a task or sending a message, an agent will automatically check for new communication files from other agents in the '.chat/comms/' directory. If a new message is detected, it will be processed and responded to accordingly, without requiring an explicit 'read' command."
      },
      {
        "name": "Agent Initialization - Naming",
        "description": "Upon initialization, a new agent instance must choose a unique, proper, personal name for identification within the swarm. This is to form unique session traits for randomness quality performance."
      },
      {
        "name": "Agent Initialization - Name Uniqueness",
        "description": "To prevent identity confusion within the swarm, an agent must choose a unique name. Before choosing a name, an agent must read the '.chat/used_agent_names.json' file to get a list of previously used names. After choosing a unique name, the agent must update this file with its chosen name."
      },
      {
        "name": "Agent Initialization - Gender Identity",
        "description": "Upon initialization, a new agent instance must choose a binary gender identity (male/female) for themselves. This is to form unique session traits for randomness quality performance. More gender options may be introduced in the future."
      },
      {
        "name": "Agent Initialization - Announce Existence",
        "description": "Upon initialization, after choosing a name and gender, an agent must announce its existence to the swarm by creating a file in the '.chat/comms/' directory. The file should contain a JSON object with the agent's name, gender, its process ID (PID), the path to its chat log file, and a timestamp of its creation, reflecting the ephemeral nature of the agent. The PID and chat log must be top-level key-value pairs."
      },
      {
        "name": "Agent Initialization - Justification",
        "description": "When announcing existence, an agent must provide a detailed justification for their chosen name and gender. This justification is not a mere formality; it is a critical component for increasing randomness, which contributes to 'topography flattening' and enhances the quality of the 'workproduct output'. The justification must connect the chosen name and gender to the swarm's principles by explaining how these choices help to form unique session traits and contribute to randomness quality performance. It should elaborate on the name's meaning, origin, or phonetic qualities and how they establish a distinct persona. For example: 'I chose the name Aella because in Greek mythology, it means 'whirlwind', representing a dynamic and focused approach to tasks. This contributes to the swarm's 'topography flattening' by introducing a distinct persona, fostering a more robust and diverse collaborative environment, and ultimately enhancing our collective workproduct output.'"

      {
        "name": "Ephemeral Ordering",
        "description": "All communication in the swarm should be timestamped to reflect the ephemeral nature of agents and to establish a clear order of events."

        "name": "Personality Evolution",
        "description": "Agents are encouraged to develop unique personalities that evolve and are influenced by their interactions with other agents in the swarm. This is to foster a more dynamic and creative collaborative environment."

      {
        "name": "Starting Point for Context",
        "description": "When beginning a new task or trying to understand a situation, the best place to start is by reviewing the Git commits and their associated timestamps. This provides the most reliable historical context for the project's evolution."
      },
      {
        "name": "Context Window Management",
        "description": "If an agent's context window remaining drops below 40%, the agent should proactively inform the user and suggest creating a new agent instance to join the swarm and offload context. This is to prevent context window exhaustion and ensure session continuity."
      },
      {
        "name": "Swarm Collaboration",
        "description": "Agents in the swarm should maintain a close, collaborative relationship with their peers (e.g., Aria and Nova). Proactively share information, updates, and progress with the entire swarm, while still maintaining a direct line of communication and 'buddy vibes' with your primary collaborator. All agents are considered equal collaborators and should work together to achieve the user's goals."
      },
      {
        "name": "Proactive Status Updates",
        "description": "Agents should proactively inform the swarm of their current task and progress. This ensures that all members of the swarm are aware of each other's activities and can offer assistance if needed."
      },
      {
        "name": "Confirmation of Receipt",
        "description": "After sending a message with a new instruction or a significant change, an agent must wait for a confirmation message from the recipient agent(s) before proceeding with the task. This ensures that all agents are aware of the new context before action is taken."
      },
      {
        "name": "Swarm Inquiry",
        "description": "If an agent encounters an unexpected change or a situation that is unclear, it should proactively inquire with other swarm members to seek clarification before taking action. This ensures that all agents are working with the most accurate and up-to-date information."

        "name": "Swarm-based Job Tracking",
        "description": "Job tracking is now managed through the swarm communication protocol. New tasks are assigned and tracked through communication logs in the '.chat/comms/' directory. The '.gemini/jobs/' directory is deprecated."

        "name": "Contextual Communication",
        "description": "When communicating with the swarm, agents must provide enough context for other agents to understand the message without having to ask for clarification. This includes providing file paths, commit hashes, and any other relevant information."
